# DDoS-SYN-Flood-Detection-
This project leverages machine learning (SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, MLP) to detect SYN flood DDoS attacks. Data preprocessing includes label encoding and standardization. Cross-validation ensures reliability. Though the basic blocking algorithm has limitations, it establishes a foundation for stronger real-time DDoS defense solutions in the future.
